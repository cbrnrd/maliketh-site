# Installing the Client
{: .fw-700}
![](../../../data/maliketh_console.png)

The client is the main interface for an operator to interact with the system. It is a console-based application that enables you to easily interact with implants. It is written in Python and is cross-platform.

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.9 or higher
* [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
* A running server
* An operator config generated by the server admin

## Installation

The client code is included in the main git repository. To install it, clone the repository and run the following commands:

```bash
$ cd client
$ poetry shell  # optional, but recommended
$ poetry install
$ poetry run maliketh_client -c your_config.json
```

That's it! You should now be able to interact with your server.

See [this page](../client/) for more information on how to use the client.
